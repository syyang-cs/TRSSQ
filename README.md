# Representive Similarity Score Estimation (RSSE)

## Introduction
Representive Similarity Score Estimation (RSSE) is a deep learning framework designed for efficient and accurate estimation of subtrajectory similarities within large trajectory datasets. RSSE addresses the challenge of high computational costs in trajectory similarity tasks and introduces the novel concept of Representative Similarity. This method ensures diverse data representation by selecting only the most similar subtrajectory from each trajectory in a set.
